# Mr. OTCS version 2.0.0 playlist file example

# Insert file names of videos in this file, one per line.
# Blank lines and comment lines like this one are ignored.
# Comments can begin with #, ;, or //.

# Lines starting with : are extra entries, which are comments that get inserted into the schedule.
# Add a space and a : after a file name to attach extra info to it, which is inserted into the schedule. Everything that follows the : will be included.
# See alt_names_examples.json for examples on how to change how video names are written into the schedule.

# Lines starting with % are commands that control the stream.
# There are currently two commands:
# %RESTART: Force the stream to restart. The videos defined in STREAM_RESTART_BEFORE_VIDEO and STREAM_RESTART_AFTER_VIDEO, if any, will be played.
# %INSTANT_RESTART: Force the stream to restart immediately. The videos defined in STREAM_RESTART_BEFORE_VIDEO and STREAM_RESTART_AFTER_VIDEO will not be played.
