# Mr. OTCS version 2.2.0 playlist file example
# https://github.com/TheOpponent/mr-otcs

# Insert file names of videos in this file, one per line, then rename it to playlist.txt.
# See alt_names_examples.json for examples on how to change how video names are written into the schedule.
# Add a space and a : after a file name to attach extra info to it, which is inserted into the JSON schedule file in the key "extra_info". Everything that follows the : will be included as is.
# /media/Example.mp4 :Extra info to be written into schedule

# Lines starting with : are extra entries, which are comments that get inserted into the JSON schedule file.
# See the wiki for more information: https://github.com/TheOpponent/mr-otcs/wiki/Customization#schedule-page

# Lines starting with % are commands that control the stream.
# There are currently four commands:
# %RESTART: Force the stream to restart. The videos defined in STREAM_RESTART_BEFORE_VIDEO and STREAM_RESTART_AFTER_VIDEO, if any, will be played.
# %INSTANT_RESTART: Force the stream to restart immediately. The videos defined in STREAM_RESTART_BEFORE_VIDEO and STREAM_RESTART_AFTER_VIDEO will not be played.
# %STOP: End the stream and exit Mr. OTCS. The index in play_index.txt will be set to the line after this one after exiting.
# %MAIL: Send an e-mail alert. Any text following this command on the same line will be included in the e-mail message. If MAIL_ALERT_ON_COMMAND is False, these commands are ignored.

# Blank lines and comment lines like this one are ignored.
# Comments can begin with #, ;, or //.
